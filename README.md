# Track-Creal-Stealer
Recently, one of our team members fell victim to a stealer hack. To help you stay protected, we created this tool.
This script is designed to extract Python-coded stealers and malware, especially those written in Python 3.7.

⚠️ Note: If a hacker sends you malware like "Creal Stealer," this tool will identify it and reveal the webhook it's using to send your data.
You can use this information to create a similar webhook for testing purposes or even spam their webhook to disrupt their activities.

This tool is strictly for educational purposes and self-defense only. If you experience any issues or need help, DM me on Discord: murtesa_gamer.
Stay safe, stay informed, and protect yourself. ✨
