Track-Creal-Stealer
Recently, one of our team members fell victim to a stealer hack. To help you stay protected, we created this tool.
This script is designed to extract Python-coded stealers and malware, particularly those written in Python 3.7.

⚠️ Note: If a hacker sends you malware labeled as "Creal Stealer" or similar, this script can help detect and extract it.
This tool is strictly for educational purposes and self-defense only.

If you experience any bugs or need assistance, feel free to DM me on Discord: murtesa_gamer.
Stay safe, stay informed, and protect yourself. ✨
